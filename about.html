            <p>
              I'm a full stack software engineer with a
              background in Indigenous language revitalization.
              I'm also a certified Spanish<->English
              interpreter/translator with experience in education and IT. While teaching
              English in Japan, I realized my desire to shift into tech and help
              develop tools that advance social justice and fulfill my
              creative mind. I love front-end design technologies like Sass and
              Mapbox, as well as the possibilities of Unity, and Phaser in game design.
