        <div class="about__bio">
          <p>
            I'm a full stack software engineer with a background in Indigenous
            language revitalization. I'm also a certified Spanish<->English
            interpreter/translator with experience in education and IT. While
            teaching English in Japan, I realized my desire to shift into tech
            and help develop tools that advance social justice and fulfill my
            creative mind. I love front-end design technologies like Sass and
            Mapbox, as well as the possibilities of Unity and Phaser in game
            development.
